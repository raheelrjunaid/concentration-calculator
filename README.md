# Chemical Strategy List:

## Concentration Conversion Factor
5% == 5g / 500g (same units are required. It doesn't matter if it is Volume or Mass)

### Finding %w/w
Formulas: g / g * 100%
- Finding Mass: C / 100 (Remove percentage with unit of w/w)
    Ex. 12%w/w == 12g / 100g

### Finding %w/v
Formulas: g / ml * 100%
- Finding Volume: C / 100 (Remove percentage with unit of w/v)
    Ex. 12%v/v == 12g / 100mL
    
### Finding %v/v
Formulas: L / L * 100%
- Finding Volume: C / 100 (Remove percentage with unit of v/v)
    Ex. 12%v/v == 12L / 100L

## Finding ppm
Formulas: mg / kg or mg / L
- Finding Mass/Volume present in specific Mass/Volume == C * V/m
    (Multiply by final volume or mass)

## Finding Molarity (mol/L)
Formulas: C = n / V
